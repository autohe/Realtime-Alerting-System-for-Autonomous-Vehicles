# Realtime-Alerting-System-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
The following repository contains the code for the paper :
## "AN EVALUATION METRIC FOR OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS IN AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION SYSTEMS AND ITS APPLICATION TO A REAL-TIME ALERTING SYSTEM" which has been submitted to IEEE ICIP,2018.

## The repository may be divided into two sections:
### 1. Metric Scoring:
This folder contains the code for scoring the clone and bad image weather conditions.It also contains precalculated scores on VKITTI dataset for the 0001,0002,0006,0018,0020 folder.

### 2. Realtime alerting: 
The second folder contains the script for running a realtime alerting system using the precalculated distance vectors from VGG 16 which are made available here:
